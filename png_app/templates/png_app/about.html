            Welcome to JJNN — where your news experience is as unique as you are.<br><br>
            This project is part of an academic journey in machine learning and software development. 
            The aim is to create a personalised news platform that learns from your preferences and recommends articles that matter to you.<br><br>
            Behind the scenes, a recommendation engine powered by natural language processing (NLP) carefully selects articles tailored to your interests.<br><br>
            Rather than giving you the same news as everyone else, Jesus Joenas News Network (JJNN) crafts a reading list just for you — because your time (and curiosity) deserve better.<br><br>
            Thanks for visiting — and happy reading!
